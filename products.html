				<h2>Mountainboarding</h2>
				<p>In the 1990s a new way to use a board was invented. Snowboards are usually limited to winter sports 
				seasons or specialized winter sport tracks halls. But with mountainboards people can now board downhill on 
				dirt tracks or any other place outside. It requires more durable boards and shock resistance for the wheels. 
				With gaining popularity and competitions the technology for mountainboards have been making major strides. Focusing mainly on 
				speed, control, and durability. And because the sport is a bit younger than other extreme sports the 
				companies are still experimenting with materials.

				<h2>Benefits of mountainboards</h2>
				<p>Mountain boarding mainly solves the need for <em>specific weather or terrain conditions</em>. It is basically allowing people 
				to snowboard on dirt, sand, and road. There is no reason to wait for winter sports seasons. Also, there is always a chance 
				that the winter sport season doesn’t produce enough snow to snowboard on.
				With de mountainboard you don’t have to rely on those challenges and are you able to practice all year round.

				<h2>How to use a mountainboard</h2>
				<p>To use a mountainboard you must make wide turns to get momentum. Since you are strapped to your board you can’t step like a skateboard
				to go forward. So, it is more similar to snowboarding then skateboarding. In order to turn you have to apply pressure to the front or back of 
				the board and shift your weight. It is not about just going downhill real fast as you can.

				<h2>Who is mountainboarding</h2>
				<p><strong>Patrick McConnel</strong> and <strong>Jason Lee</strong> made the first mountainboards in California in the United States. The two friends started a company in 1994 
				called MBS and started manufacturing mountainboards ever since. The users where mainly snowboarders who where bored in the spring and summer months.
				Looking for a way to keep themselves busy till snowboard season arrives. Now that the sport took off, many extreme sporters are giving it a try.

				<h2>What can you expect</h2>
				<p>In the future we can expect more promotion for mountainboarding. With new cameras that can shoot in different
				frames per seconds for beautiful slow-motion shots. Or with drones that can film from angles that used to be only 
				possible with helicopters. People can now make the most entertaining 
				and cool promotion videos of the sport. That will bring more advertisers and sports events for the sport in the future.

				<h2>Future innovations</h2>
				<p>Innovations regarding mountainboards are mainly the same as skateboards. It is about using better materials for the board decks making the
				wheels more durable and better suited for controlling the board. But now innovation is heading towards motorizing the board. In the beginning it was more a combustion
				type motor but now innovations are being made towards <strong>electric motors</strong>. Just like any other extreme sports everything to make you go faster.
